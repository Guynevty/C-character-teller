# C++-character-teller
yo it tells you how many characters are in your sentence.
if ya don't have a c++ compiler then run omg.exe in terminal/command prompt by copying the location and removing the speech marks from it (so if you're on windows) by copying the path onto any text editor and simply removing the speech marks, then paste it into your terminal/command prompt and run the code.

if you have a c++ compiler then you know the drill.
I added the extra stuff because why not?
